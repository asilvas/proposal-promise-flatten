    Background for  <a href="https://github.com/asilvas/proposal-promise-flatten">tc39/proposal-promise-flatten</a>,
    inspired by  <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWells/status/1119729914876284928">David Wells</a>.

  <h1><span class="secnum">2</span>Promise.prototype.flatten()</h1>

  <p><code>flatten</code> resolves all outcomes of a Promise into a tuple <code>[rejectValue, resolveValue]</code> to reduce code footprint and improve readability:</p>

  <emu-alg><ol><li>Always return a tuple.</li><li>Promise <code>reject</code> returned as-is at index zero of the returned tuple, or <code>undefined</code> on <code>resolve</code>.</li><li>Promise <code>resolve</code> returned as-is at index one of the returned tuple, or <code>undefined</code> on <code>reject</code>.</li><li>Never throws/rejects.
  </li></ol></emu-alg>
